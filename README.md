# CSV ANALYZER USING LANGCHAIN'S CHAINS and AGENTS 

🚀 🚀 ANALYZE YOUR CSV WITH A SINGLE PROMPT WITH LANGCHAIN'S CHAINS AND AGENTS 🚀 🚀 

🌐My seventh project with my mentor, SHARATH RAJU, explores LANGCHAIN'S CHAINS and AGENTS modules, diving deep into its capabilities to revolutionize DATA ANALYSIS. 

🌟A CSV ANALYZER developed using Streamlit and LangChain, enabling users to effortlessly RETRIEVE INSIGHTS from their CSV with JUST A QUERY!

💡 The project uses PANDAS DATAFRAME AGENT from LANGCHAIN to translate the user's query into code, RUNS the code against the CSV, and then retrieves the answer to users in terms of TEXT. 

👇 The dataset used is a simple transaction dataset with 811 rows and 53 columns. The columns consist of the PRODUCT_CODE and the 52 WEEKS of the year. Each row represent the WEEKLY SALES for each product. In summary, the CSV tracks the WEEKLY SALES of 811 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS across the year and is retrieved from KAGGLE

In the FIGURES below, you can see how the LLM is able to execute CODE from simple text such as: 

1) How many rows are there? 
2) What are the column names? 
3) What is the product that has the highest sales in week 5? 

In the last figure, you can see the THOUGHT PROCESS of LangChain's Agent, highlighting the ability to track how the AGENT IS THINKING AND ACTING along the way. 



LANGCHAIN IS TRULY ANOTHER BEAST. 🔥 🔥 🔥
